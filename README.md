# Big_data_Project - Water Potability Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict the potability of water based on various water quality parameters such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, and organic carbon, among others. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
